Fugro:

The attached shapefile identifies the potential deliverable ortho tiles for 
year 2; it includes the year 1/year 2 tie tiles.  Please note that this 
shapefile is a draft and does not represent the exact tiles that will be 
delivered for year 2.  We’ll have to hold back tie tiles for future production 
years and we won’t know which tiles we’ll need to hold back until the AT is 
complete for each block.
