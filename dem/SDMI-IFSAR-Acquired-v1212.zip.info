Rebecca Anderson - USGS Alaska Liason:
--
I was at USGS in Reston this week and was able to talk with the imagery lead to get an IfSAR update. The first block of the 2012 IfSAR data collect will be entering QA/QC at NGTOC in January and, assuming all goes well, will be ready for release in February. Rather than one large delivery, the data will be sent to NGTOC in blocks. NGTOC will perform their review and release the blocks to the State as soon as they are completed, with data delivery expected from January to September.
