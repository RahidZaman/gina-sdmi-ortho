The SPOT5 source scenes used to make the Statewide Digital Mapping Initiative (SDMI) 
statewide ortho-mosaic. See http://www.alaskamapped.org/ortho

The data was produced under State of Alaska contract # DNR 10-10-062, with
Aero-Metric as prime contractor and Spot Image and Fugro Earthdata as
subcontractors.

The first thing to note is: *THIS IS NOT A MAP PRODUCT*.  Although geo-referenced
products are included in the file package, they are just browse images for
previewing the data. The scene has not been ortho-rectified or had any control
applied.  

The source scenes come in two pairs

   1. B: panchromatic (single band 2.5 meter resolution)
   2. J: multi-spectral (four 10 meter bands - red, green, near IR, shortwave IR)

The scene01/imagery.tif is the Level 1A product as comes from Spot Image.
