###############################################################################

This is the README file for the Statewide Digital Mapping Initiative’s (SDMI) 
ortho mosaic tiles.  The ortho tiles provided here are derived from the 2011 
block production using SPOT5 source scenes from the 2009 and 2010 collection 
season. 

The ortho tiles within this block are map products and are differentially 
rectified using the aerotriangulation results and the elevation data to produce 
orthoimagery with a horizontal spatial resolution equal to 2.5 meter per pixel. 
 These are available in three separate renderings, each co-registered and in 
uncompressed GeoTIFF format as a 20,000m x 20,000m (8000x8000 pixels) tile: 

    CIR: 24 bit false color-infrared 
    RGB: 24 bit simulated natural color
    PAN: 8 bit panchromatic - greyscale of the RGB

The following production block files are also supplied with this bundle: AT 
Report in PDF format, AT block boundary in ESRI shapefile format, cutlines in 
ESRI shapefile format, QC Master in PDF format, scene boundaries in ESRI 
shapefile format, and tile layout in ESRI shapefile format.

Each SDMI ortho tile set (RGB, PAN, CIR) is accompanied with FGDC compliant 
metadata. Please refer to the metadata files for detailed descriptions of the 
data products.  

The SPOT5 L1A source scenes used to generate these ortho tiles are available to 
licensed users from the AlaskaMapped browse site:
http://browse.alaskamapped.org/display/group/SPOT5.SDMI.SOURCE-L1A

SDMI orthoimagery program background:
The State of Alaska is creating an updated basemap for the state. Reliable, 
current, statewide base geographic information is essential for continued 
economic development, livability, and public safety. Ortho-imagery is 
considered a foundation element for the framework of base geographic data. At 
this time, Alaska does not have an updated statewide digital ortho imagery with 
a high enough resolution and accuracy to meet most user needs. The new 
ortho-imagery being captured and processed by this project will provide a 
common layer that shows current conditions and trends over the Alaska 
landscape. It will also allow other types of geographic information to be 
extracted and registered. This ortho-imagery will allow Alaskan agencies and 
private organizations to better utilize geographic information systems (GIS) 
and other mapping technologies to aid in responsible decision making. This data 
acquisition program will provide statewide coverage within five years (by 
2014). The State of Alaska funded the Statewide Digital Mapping Initiative to 
remedy this short-coming and to strengthen the alignment between state and 
federal mapping interests. The SDMI goal is a new statewide basemap, composed 
of ortho-imagery and elevation models. Moving forward the state would like to 
acquire refreshed imagery on a 3-5 year cycle, and to extend the extent of 
available imagery to include the three-mile territorial waters of Alaska and 
the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), which extends 200 miles offshore. In 
November 2009, the SDMI entered into a partnership with federal partners 
representing the National Geospatial Agency, U.S. Geological Survey, Bureau of 
Land Management, U.S.D.A. Natural Resources Conservation Service and National 
Park Service to collect mid-accuracy (6-foot RMSE-z) DEM for the state. This 
collection is expected to occur in phases, with the first phase for collection 
of (28) one-degree cells beginning in 2010. SDMI managers are continuing to 
work with federal managers to develop an active federal program for the state. 
In August 2008, Alaska sponsored a joint meeting of the National Digital 
Elevation Program and National Digital Ortho-imagery Program. SDMI managers 
also directed planning contracts, surveys, multiple presentations, and two 
technical workshops, one on elevation and one on imagery. Each workshop 
resulted in a published whitepaper.
